title: Lyric attempts and some thoughts on life
description: 'Some attempts to write lyrics for the music I want to create as part of my band Seven Minutes. And some life thoughts.'

This is a pretty different writing from what usually people write on the web. This writing is part of my thoughts and what I
go through or think daily.

I do music with my band [Seven Minutes](https://www.facebook.com/sevenminutes/) for 6 years now. We haven't really made a
breakthrough yet in the industry but we have created our own music and lyrics though our own journeys. The band consists of two
members only, including me.

The lyrics that we wrote for our music came up through our own fights of depression and everyday life. We are still working on the
music on all of them and working for an album.

The whole point of this piece of writing is to showcase a lyric that I wrote very recently, based on my current scenario in life.

It's a song in progress that we're making. I'm gonna write two lines from the song.

> The light in my eyes, fades away.
>
> This song in my mind, wants to play.

These are two lines from inside the song. I wrote this and some other lines within 5 minutes. I am going through a point of my life
where I'm suffering from immense depression and going through a tough time figuring out what to do.

When I do music and come up with these lines, it helps me feel a little better about everything.

_Because I know someone will listen to it._

I would know, ***that I am not alone in this fight***.

If anybody stumbles upon this writing, ***know*** that _you are not alone in this fight_.
