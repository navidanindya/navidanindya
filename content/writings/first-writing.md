title: First writing!
description: 'First writing on the internet by Navid Anindya. Also a small LPT for JavaScript coders on writing `console` statements.'
---

### Intro

I finally started this. I finally designed something to start writing.

It's crazy how **procrastination** can get you into a place where you keep snoozing something.

I am just going to write some `javascript` here underneath to see how the design works out,
with a very simple **LPT (life pro tip)** that I think most coders who write `javascript` will like.

### The `console.assert` LPT

```js
// Instead of writing this
if (!loggedIn) {
  console.log("Not logged in.");
}

// We can use console.assert and write it in a single line
console.assert(loggedIn, "Not logged in");
```

### Conclusion?

I have yet to finish the design and some other small features to add in this site.
I'll also be writing more stuff soon.

Hopefully y'all like the simple LPT! Have a great day. :)
