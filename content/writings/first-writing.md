### Intro

I finally started this. I finally desgined something to start writing.

It's crazy how **procrastination** can get you into a place where you keep snoozing something.

I am just going to write some `<html>` here underneath to see how the design works out.

### Some HTML code

```html
<article class="prose">
  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
    springing up around the country.
  </p>
  <!-- ... -->
</article>
```


### Conclusion?

I have yet to finish the design and some other small features to add in this site.
I'll also be writing more stuff soon.
